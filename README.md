# Gratitude Journal App - Frontend

## Description
This frontend application allows users to journal their daily thoughts, what they are grateful for, what they are looking forward to, and their accomplishments.

## Motivation
I embarked on this project to explore the world of animations in React, understanding the nuances of dealing with the virtual DOM as opposed to the actual DOM. I developed a unique way to animate components, learned about state management, and navigated the decision-making process between using Redux or React's built-in state management tools. I also gained experience with React Router, props, lifting up state to avoid prop drilling, and creating multiple frontend pages using the single-page app React library.

## Technologies Used
This project is built with the following technologies:

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML: Used for structuring the web pages.
- CSS: Used for styling the web pages.
- JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity to the web pages.

## Features
Here are the key features of this project:

1. **Form Handling**: This feature allows users to input their thoughts and feelings into the app.
2. **API Integration**: The app communicates with a backend server for storing and retrieving journal entries.
3. **JSON**: JSON is used for data interchange between the frontend and the backend.
4. **Scoped Styling**: Styles are scoped to individual components, preventing unwanted side effects in other parts of the application.
5. **CRUD Operations**: Users can journal about their gratitudes, anticipations and accomplishments.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/bonolo2s/Gratitude-Journal.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Gratitude-Journal-FrontEnd`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You can then create, read, update, and delete journal entries provided you have also
cloned the backend code.
